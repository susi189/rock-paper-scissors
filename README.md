About this project

This is a very basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with a very simple design.

The player plays against the computer, and when one of them scores 5 points the game ends. There is a final page that shows the outcome of the game.

This was one of the first projects that I built from scratch. I used simple HTML and CSS and mostly practiced working with vanilla JavaScript.

NOTE: I impoved the design of this game [here](https://github.com/susi189/rps-game)
