**About this project**

This is a basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with a very simple design. Click [here](https://susi189.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) to play the game.

The player plays against the computer and when one of them scores 5 points the game ends. There is a final page that shows the outcome of the game.

This was one of the first projects that I built from scratch. I used simple HTML and CSS and mostly practiced working with vanilla JavaScript.

NOTE: I improved the design of this game [here](https://github.com/susi189/rps-game).
